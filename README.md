# IFC-LCA
Store LCA information in IFC-SPF!

Contents and structure of product data (generic and EPDs) IfcProjectLibrary files is based on EN ISO 22057 - "Data templates for the use of environmental product declarations (EPDs) for construction products in building information modelling (BIM)". EPDs in the EN ISO 220557 JSON format are taken from the epd-norway pilot project (see https://digi.epd-norge.no/iso-22057/).

The building-level properties are based on the spreadsheet comparing various LCA information sources ("BuildingLCAInformationRequirementsComparison.xlsx").

This is the result of my master thesis entitled "A Methodology for Integrating Life Cycle Assessment Data within the IFC Schema through openBIM Workflows".
