# IFC-LCA
Store LCA information in IFC-SPF!

Contents and structure of product data (generic and EPDs) IfcProjectLibrary files is based on EN ISO 22057 - "Data templates for the use of environmental product declarations (EPDs) for construction products in building information modelling (BIM)".

The building-level properties are based on the spreadsheet comparing various LCA information sources ("BuildingLCAInformationRequirementsComparison.xlsx").

This is the result of my master thesis entitled "A Methodology for Integrating Life Cycle Assessment Data within the IFC Schema through openBIM Workflows".
